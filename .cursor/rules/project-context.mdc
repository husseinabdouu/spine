# Project Context

For every conversation in this project, read and apply the context from these files:

- `docs/cursor-context/VISION.md` - Project vision and big picture
- `docs/cursor-context/GOALS.md` - Goals and objectives
- `docs/cursor-context/CONTEXT.md` - General context, architecture, conventions
- `docs/cursor-context/DECISIONS.md` - Important decisions and constraints

Apply this context to all suggestions, code, and responses. Align with the vision and goals.
